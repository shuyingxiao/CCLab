    Reflection

  </h1>

  <p class="paragraphs1">
    In this sketch, only a few variables are set because I want to emphasize the change of size and color along with the
    movement of the mouse. However, variables are beneficial when one certain value needs to be retrieved again during
    the process of “drawing”. Therefore, in this project, I stored a background color in a variable so that I can easily
    get back to the color without entering the values.

  </p>

  <p class="paragraphs2">
    The conditions used in this project are simple: when certain keys are pressed, it triggers a corresponding pattern
    of colors. Also, I used this skill when I need to clear the whole sketch by setting a condition of key pressing. The
    “keyCode” is a variable that can detect special keys, while the “key” can be used for all keys on the keyboard.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraphs3">
    In this project, I want to use the position of the mouse to change the size and color of the circle drawn so that it
    becomes an interactive sketch. To achieve this goal, I replaced one variable in both color and size with the
    position of the mouse so that when the mouse is moved, these two properties will be changed. More interestingly, if
    the mouse moves continuously, a dynamic image will be created. Also, it is satisfying to observe how the density
    circles when the velocity of mouse movement changes.
